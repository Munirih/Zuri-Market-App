# Zuri Market e-commerce Platform Deployment to Kubernetes (K3s)

## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates DevSecOps deployment pipeline for a containerized full-stack application running on Kubernetes (K3s) hosted on AWS EC2.

The project demonstrates modern DevOps and DevSecOps practices including:

- AWS Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Remote Terraform State Management with state locking (S3 Bucket)
- Containerization with Docker
- GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Application Dependencies and Container Vulnerability Scanning using Trivy
- Secret Management with AWS Secrets Manager
- IAM Roles with least privilege for Secure Access
- AWS SDK for runtime secrets retrieval
- Application Deployment to Kubernetes Cluster using Deployments and Services and Ingress objects



## 2. Pre-requisites


- Docker and Docker Desktop
- Node.js installed
- AWS CLI installed
- Terraform installed
- AWS SDK Client manager installed in backend folder
